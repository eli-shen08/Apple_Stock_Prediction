Predicting the closing price of apple stock from 2019 to the end of 2020 with the help of LSTM Neural Network.
First I have used pandas data reader to fetch the stock of apple from the year 2014 to the end of 2020 .
Then i have visualized the data .
Then I performed feature engineering so that we can feed it to our model .
I have used LSTM neural network thorugh which i had been able to achieve an extremely low RMSE value of around 2.
